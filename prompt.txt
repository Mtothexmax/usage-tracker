i want to track usage also when a video is played and the mouse is not moving for 5 minutes. is there a general way how to do that in rust? or does it have to be implemented os specific





something like this



#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
fn is_media_playing() -> bool {
    // Use windows-rs to check GlobalSystemMediaTransportControls
    true // simplified
}

#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
fn is_media_playing() -> bool {
    // Check pmset assertions for 'PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep'
    true // simplified
}

fn check_activity() {
    let idle_time = get_idle_time(); // Using device_query
    
    if idle_time < Duration::from_mins(5) {
        log_active();
    } else if is_media_playing() {
        log_active(); // Still active because video is on!
    } else {
        log_idle();
    }
}




also when i do not reload the ui the time is sometimes not counted up. can there be a regular ui update?


also can you please make the details view in the bottom only show the summed up time and only when one clicks on more details one sees a popup that shows the sessions + breaks.

also please remove the text usage tracker and monitor your computer activity patterns
